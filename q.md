#Questions


(a) reads an unsigned integer from the keyboard and prints the following message "The sum of digits of the read number < the read number > is < its sum of digits calculated by the program>."

(b) Modify the above program so that it accepts a string which consists of both digits and non-digit characters. The program should however print the sum of only the digits, while ignoring the non-digit characters.

For example: if the string input is 12ABC?3, 
		the sum is 6

(c) reads in three integers and prints the sum of the largest two of the three.

(d) reads in a positive integer; if the integer is not positive, the program terminates with the message “Invalid Entry”; otherwise, the program prints the names of the digits of the integers, delimited by exactly one space. For example, if the user entered “728,” the output would be “Seven Two Eight.”

(e) In this problem you should use the concept of assigning integer variables 
as local variables on stack.
(i) reads an integer in a local variable "inp" (with proper prompt),
(ii) checks whether it is a perfect number or not -- i.e., whether its 
factors including 1 and excluding itself sum to itself, and
(iii) accordingly prints a proper message.

(f)Write a recursive MIPS program that computes and prints first N terms of Fibonacci Sequence.

(g)Write a  MIPS program that computes gcd of a set of numbers.  Numbers are taken as  Input  
but the size of the set is not given. Print the current gcd after each input. The program
should terminate when -1 is given as input. 

(h)Write a recursive MIPS program to print the reverse of a given string.
